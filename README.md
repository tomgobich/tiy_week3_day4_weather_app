# Weekly Forecast Weather App

##### The Iron Yard - Week 3, Day 4

The goal of this assignment was to create a weather application that shows the weekly forecast for any area the user inputs using the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

### This application features the following:

- Animated background gradient to add a dynamic aspect to the design.
- At the 700px breakpoint, the design will go from a column to row layout for the different days.
- A toggle in the top right to easily switch between celcius and fahrenheit. This is done locally instead of calling the API again for increased load speeds and to prevent an unnessessary call to the API. This is also saved in and loaded from local storage.
- The icons were swapped from the ones provided by the OpenWeatherMap API to fit the design better, if for some reason a code unaccounted for should appear, the icon will fall back to the OpenWeatherMap icon.
